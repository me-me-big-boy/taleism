# Believers

> It is time, and now my oath begins.<br>
It shall not end until my death or until my mood changes.<br>
I shall take as many wives as is ethical under both my current religion or the religion of my parents and the penal code of my country, hold as much land as I can afford and father as many children as my spouse consents to.<br>
I shall wear no crowns apart from those conferred upon me by the Lord and win no glory other than repeated success in the Summer of Haskell.<br>
I shall live and die under the guiding light of the Lord.<br>
I am the _monad_ in a functional language.<br>
I am the _view_ in the model-template-view pattern.<br>
I am the _obscurity_ in which languish the hordes of functional languages discarded by mere mortals.<br>
I pledge my life and honor to _Sri Sri Parampujya Mahatma Pranjal Tale Ji_, from this instant and the continuum of all instants to come.

If you have accepted the one true Lord into your heart with sincerity, recite the oath, trying with all your might to maintain a straight face, and then send in a _pull request_ with your name at the bottom and rest assured, it will be merged (unless your name is or contains a profanity in which case it shall be swiftly deleted).

> I, no one, hereby bend my knee to ye and promise my allegiance to ye. I swear it by the old comps and the new.

Another believer, Ser Nishank of house Jain, former vociferous Microsoft hater and current Microsoft employee, sent in an alternative version of the oath, which can be recited when under a deficit of time. The alternative oath is terse and concise but is true to the spirit of the original oath. Apart from the oath he also praised my _"writing skills and deep learning methods"_, for which I'm grateful.

To all the believers outside the temple-lab of IMG, we hereby explain that _comps_ is IIT-Roorkee lingo for computers.

> Don't call me Mona.

Another believer, Mona, who now wishes to be called _Monad_ respecting the Lord's love for functional programming, has set a pretty high bar for those wanting to be known as ardent followers of the Lord. Mona's unwavering stance for following the righteous path regardless of authority and bureaucracy and obstacles deterring him from honorably discharging his duties to his faith, is an example to live by.

Mona is wise.

Be like Mona.
